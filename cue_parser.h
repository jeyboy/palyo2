//CATALOG
//Description:

//This command is used to specify the disc's “Media Catalog Number”. It will typically be used only when mastering a CDROM for commercial production.

//<<

//CDTEXTFILE
//Description:

//This command is used to specify the name of the file that contains the encoded CD-TEXT information for the disc. This command is only used with files that were either created with the graphical CD-TEXT editor or generated automatically by the software when copying a CD-TEXT enhanced disc.
//Syntax:

//CDTEXTFILE [filename]
//Parameters:

//filename – Filename (can include device/directory). If the filename contains any spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
//Examples:

//CDTEXTFILE C:\TEST\DISC.CDT
//CDTEXTFILE “C:\LONG FILENAME.CDT”
//Rules:

//If your recorder does not support CD-TEXT, then this command will be ignored.

//<<

//FILE
//Description:

//This command is used to specify a data/audio file that will be written to the recorder.
//Syntax:

//FILE [filename] [filetype]
//Parameters:

//filename – Filename (can include device/directory).

//If the filename contains any spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

//filetype – Filetype

//The following filetypes are allowed…

//BINARY – Intel binary file (least significant byte first)
//MOTOROLA – Motorola binary file (most significant byte first)

//FILE “C:\MUSIC\TRACK2.WAV” WAVE
//FILE “C:\MUSIC\LONG FILENAME.MP3″ MP3
//Rules:

//FILE commands must appear before any other command except CATALOG.

//This rule contradicts the examples on this site: Note.
//Note:

//For AUDIO files, if the length of the data within the file is not an exact multiple of the CDROM sector size (2352 bytes), then the last sector will be padded with zeros when it is recorded to the blank disc.

//<<

//Description:

//This command is used to specify indexes (or subindexes) within a track.
//Syntax:

//INDEX [number] [mm:ss:ff]

//INDEX 05 02:34:50

//All index numbers must be between 0 and 99 inclusive. The first index must be 0 or 1 with all other indexes being sequential to the first one. The first index of a file must start at 00:00:00.

//INDEX 0 Specifies the starting time of the track “pregap”.

//INDEX 1 Specifies the starting time of the track data. This is the only index that is stored in the disc’s table-of-contents.

//INDEX > 1 Specifies a subindex within a track.

//<<

//ISRC
